Do you SUM(ROOM NIGHTSyear)/SUM(SUPPLYyear)

We are testing GROUP
-ADR
-RevPAR
-OCC

We have to bake the entire compset down into one compset growth average.
We aren't interested in the size of the comp set, we are interested in the relative sizes of the comp set growth, just that they are competitors who have some level of growth.

The new charts should have three lines for growth... Monterey County, City of Monterey, and Compset Average.

After these 3 graphs are completed with 3 lines each.



Take a look at ADR or RevPAR with TID Growth overlaid. so it will contain 4 lines. 1 of our Compset average, 2 representing us and 1 represented TID


REPLACE
-The data in Comp-Set-STR-ALL for Monterey City, CA with Monterey-County-City-STR-ALL..

Need to make it consistent with my first released set of data

257,Alliah Sheta calculate social engagement/impressions,"Im hoping you can help us figure out some examples of how to calculate earned social engagement/impressions. I think were going to stick with impressions vs. having a value on it. 

But I found this article in adweek that Im having trouble breaking down The ultimate guide to measuring earned media value on Facebook:  http://www.adweek.com/digital/the-definitive-guide-on-how-to-calculate-earned-media-value-emv/
Would you be able to take a look and see if theres something we can use in calculating social impressions in earned media? Were trying to get some updates for the next Marketing Committee Meeting 4/6


The other article I found: http://www.alistdaily.com/social/alist-summit-learning-measure-earned-media-value/ 
Facebooks EMV highlights include a CPC value of $0.15 and a CPE of $1.97. The system breaks each engagement down into individual values, and Likes ended up being the least valuable ($0.39), because theyre so easy to do, while comments ($1.75) and shares ($1.93) require more effort. Shares are the most valuable, because shared content is cast to a wider audience, which is extremely valuable. Cost-per-page-likes can be purchased through auction bidding, and the team also factored in organic campaigns. Page likes are especially valuable to organic campaigns, because its proof that your campaign did so well that people want to subscribe to it, which can lead to other actions like comments and shares, so thats why its valued at $1.72.
On Twitter, CPE came out to $1.73, replies are worth $1.58 and retweets are $1.67 and favorites are $1.49. Many of the values closely match Facebook, but Twitters most valuable action is gaining followers, which are valued at $2.39 each.
